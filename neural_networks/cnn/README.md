# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Financial Time-Series

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep neural networks most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. However, their ability to detect patterns in spatial data can be extended to time-series data, making them a powerful tool in quantitative finance.

## How CNNs Work on Time-Series Data

Instead of looking for patterns in a 2D grid of pixels (an image), we can use a 1D CNN to look for patterns in a sequence of data (a time-series). The core idea is to use **convolutional filters** (or kernels) that slide across the time-series to detect specific patterns or features.

For example, a filter might learn to recognize a "head and shoulders" pattern or a specific type of volatility spike in a sequence of stock prices. The network can then use the presence or absence of these detected patterns to make a prediction.

## Structure for Time-Series

A typical 1D CNN for financial forecasting includes:

1.  **Convolutional Layers:** Apply filters to the input time-series to create feature maps. These layers are designed to learn local patterns (e.g., patterns over a few days).
2.  **Pooling Layers:** Down-sample the feature maps, reducing their dimensionality and allowing the network to make its pattern detection more robust to small shifts in time.
3.  **Fully Connected Layers:** The final layers of the network, which take the high-level features detected by the convolutional layers and use them to make a final prediction (e.g., classifying the next day's price movement).

## Application in Finance

-   **Pattern Recognition in Price Charts:** Automatically detect technical analysis patterns that traders traditionally look for manually.
-   **Volatility Forecasting:** Predict future volatility by identifying patterns in historical price fluctuations.
-   **Feature Extraction:** Use the convolutional layers as a sophisticated feature engineering tool to feed into other models, like LSTMs.

CNNs are particularly useful for capturing short-term, local patterns in data, and they can be computationally more efficient than recurrent architectures for certain tasks.
