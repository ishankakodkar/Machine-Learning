# Encoder-Decoder (Seq2Seq) Models for Multi-Step Forecasting

The Encoder-Decoder, or Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq), architecture is an advanced neural network model designed for tasks where the input and output are both sequences of arbitrary lengths. While it was originally developed for machine translation, its ability to map an input sequence to an output sequence makes it highly valuable for multi-step time-series forecasting in finance.

## Architecture

The model consists of two main components, typically both implemented as LSTMs or other RNNs:

1.  **The Encoder:** This network reads the input sequence (e.g., the last 30 days of stock prices) and compresses it into a fixed-size internal representation called the **context vector** or "thought vector." This vector aims to capture the essential information from the entire input sequence.

2.  **The Decoder:** This network takes the context vector from the encoder and generates the output sequence, one step at a time (e.g., predicting the stock prices for the next 5 days). The output from one step is fed as input to the next step, allowing it to generate a coherent sequence.

This architecture allows the model to handle different lengths for the input and output sequences, providing great flexibility.

## Application in Finance

The primary advantage of the Encoder-Decoder model in finance is its ability to perform **multi-step forecasting**.

-   **Predicting Price Trajectories:** Instead of just predicting tomorrow's price, a seq2seq model can forecast the price trajectory for the next week or month. This is invaluable for more complex trading strategies and risk management.
-   **Volatility Term Structure:** Forecast the volatility of an asset not just for the next day, but over a future period.
-   **Economic Forecasting:** Predict a sequence of future GDP or inflation figures based on a sequence of past economic data.

The Encoder-Decoder model represents the state-of-the-art for many sequence-based tasks and is the final step in our hierarchy of neural network models for finance.
