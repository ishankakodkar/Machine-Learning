# Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Market Prediction

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful and versatile supervised machine learning algorithm capable of performing linear or non-linear classification, regression, and outlier detection. It is particularly well-suited for classification of complex but small- or medium-sized datasets.

In finance, SVM can be used to predict the direction of stock market movements, assess credit risk, or identify trading opportunities.

## Mathematical Formulation

The primary objective of the SVM algorithm is to find a **hyperplane** in an N-dimensional space (where N is the number of features) that distinctly classifies the data points.

### The Maximum Margin Hyperplane

For a given dataset, there may be many hyperplanes that can separate the two classes. SVM seeks to find the hyperplane that has the maximum margin, i.e., the maximum distance between data points of both classes. This provides a more robust and generalizable model.

The hyperplane is defined by the equation:

\[ \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x} - b = 0 \]

Where \( \mathbf{w} \) is the weight vector and \( b \) is the bias. The goal is to maximize the margin, which is equivalent to minimizing \( \frac{1}{2} ||\mathbf{w}||^2 \), subject to the constraint that all data points are classified correctly:

\[ y_i (\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}_i - b) \ge 1 \]

For all data points \( (\mathbf{x}_i, y_i) \), where \( y_i \) is the class label (-1 or 1).

### Support Vectors and Soft Margins

The data points that lie closest to the hyperplane are called **support vectors**. These are the critical elements of the dataset as they define the margin. In practice, data is rarely perfectly separable. The **soft margin** formulation introduces a regularization parameter, \( C \), which allows some data points to be on the wrong side of the margin, or even misclassified, in order to achieve a better overall fit.

### The Kernel Trick

For non-linearly separable data, SVMs use the **kernel trick**. This technique implicitly maps the input features into a higher-dimensional space where they become linearly separable. Common kernels include:
-   **Linear:** For linearly separable data.
-   **Polynomial:** \( (\gamma \mathbf{x}_i \cdot \mathbf{x}_j + r)^d \)
-   **Radial Basis Function (RBF):** \( \exp(-\gamma ||\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j||^2) \). This is a popular default choice.
-   **Sigmoid:** \( \tanh(\gamma \mathbf{x}_i \cdot \mathbf{x}_j + r) \)

## Application in Finance

-   **Market Direction Prediction:** Classify whether a market index will move up or down based on technical indicators and macroeconomic data.
-   **Credit Risk Analysis:** Assess the creditworthiness of applicants based on their financial history.
-   **Volatility Forecasting:** Predict periods of high vs. low market volatility.
