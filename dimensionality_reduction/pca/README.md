# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Financial Factor Analysis

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is the most widely used unsupervised algorithm for dimensionality reduction. It is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called **principal components**.

In finance, PCA is invaluable for simplifying complex, high-dimensional datasets, such as the returns of hundreds of stocks, into a smaller set of factors that explain the majority of the variance in the market.

## Mathematical Formulation

PCA aims to find the directions of maximum variance in high-dimensional data and project the data onto a new, lower-dimensional subspace without losing significant information.

The process involves the following steps:

### 1. Standardization
First, the data is standardized to ensure that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is crucial because PCA is sensitive to the scale of the features.

### 2. Covariance Matrix Computation
Next, the covariance matrix of the standardized data is computed. The covariance matrix is a square matrix that measures the covariance between each pair of features. The entry in the i-th row and j-th column is the covariance between the i-th and j-th feature.

\[ \Sigma = \frac{1}{n-1} X^T X \]

Where \( X \) is the standardized data matrix.

### 3. Eigendecomposition
The core of PCA is the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix. This process computes the **eigenvectors** and their corresponding **eigenvalues**.

\[ \Sigma v = \lambda v \]

-   **Eigenvectors (\( v \)):** These are the principal components. They represent the directions of maximum variance in the data. They are orthogonal to each other, meaning they are uncorrelated.
-   **Eigenvalues (\( \lambda \)):** These values indicate the amount of variance captured by each corresponding eigenvector. A higher eigenvalue means that its eigenvector explains more of the variance in the data.

### 4. Component Selection
The eigenvectors are sorted in descending order based on their corresponding eigenvalues. The top \( k \) eigenvectors (principal components) are selected to form the new, lower-dimensional feature space, where \( k \) is the desired number of dimensions.

The percentage of variance explained by each component is calculated as:

\[ \text{Explained Variance Ratio} = \frac{\lambda_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{p} \lambda_j} \]

Where \( p \) is the total number of features.

## Application in Finance

-   **Factor Analysis:** Identify the underlying factors driving stock returns (e.g., the first principal component often represents the overall market movement).
-   **Risk Management:** Simplify complex risk models by reducing the number of correlated risk factors.
-   **Yield Curve Construction:** Decompose the yield curve into a few key components (level, slope, and curvature) that explain most of its movements.
