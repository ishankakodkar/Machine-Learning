# Probability and Statistics for Machine Learning

Probability and statistics are the bedrock of machine learning. They provide the mathematical framework for dealing with uncertainty and for making sense of data.

## Why are Probability and Statistics Important?

*   **Understanding Data:** Statistics gives us the tools to describe, summarize, and visualize data. Concepts like mean, median, variance, and standard deviation are fundamental to understanding the properties of a dataset.
*   **Handling Uncertainty:** Machine learning models often deal with uncertain or noisy data. Probability theory allows us to quantify this uncertainty and build models that are robust to it.
*   **Model Building:** Many machine learning models are probabilistic in nature. For example, Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. Logistic regression outputs probabilities.
*   **Model Evaluation:** Statistical concepts are crucial for evaluating the performance of a model. Techniques like hypothesis testing, p-values, and confidence intervals help us determine if a model's performance is statistically significant.

## Key Concepts

*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance.
*   **Probability Distributions:** Normal, Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson.
*   **Bayes' Theorem:** The foundation of many machine learning algorithms.
*   **Hypothesis Testing:** Used to make decisions based on data.
*   **Correlation and Covariance:** Measures the relationship between variables.
